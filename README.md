# CSCI-1430: Computer Vision and Deep Learning Exercises
This repository contains a compilation of exercises from the CSCI-1430: Computer Vision and Deep Learning course at Brown University. These exercises focus on fundamental and advanced topics in computer vision, including image filtering, feature matching, camera geometry, scene classification, and deep learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

## Overview
CSCI-1430 offers an in-depth introduction to the field of computer vision and deep learning. The course begins with essential image processing techniques and progresses to modern deep learning approaches like CNNs. This repository provides hands-on coding exercises designed to reinforce concepts covered in lectures and readings.

## Exercises
1. Image Filtering: Explore fundamental image processing by applying filters such as Gaussian blur, Sobel edge detection, and Laplacian operators.
2. Feature Matching: Implement keypoint detection and feature matching techniques. Study algorithms like SIFT and Harris corner detection to match points between images for tasks like image stitching and object recognition.
3. Camera Geometry: Understand the geometry of cameras, including intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, epipolar geometry, and pose estimation.
4. Scene Classification: Implement a basic scene classification algorithm using traditional and modern approaches, including the bag-of-words model and SVM.
5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Design and train a CNN for image classification from scratch. Learn about convolutional layers, pooling, dropout, and backpropagation. Also, implement transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images into custom categories.
